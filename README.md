The following data structures are implemented in C/C++:

- ✅ Array
- ✅ Linked List (Singly, Doubly)
- ✅ Stack
- ✅ Queue
- ✅ Binary Tree
- ✅ Graph (Adjacency Matrix/List, BFS, DFS)
- ✅ Hash Table (Basic implementation)

## 🛠 Language Used

- C / C++

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each data structure has its own folder with separate source files and sample test files for better understanding.
